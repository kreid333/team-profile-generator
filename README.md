# Team Profile Generator


## Description 

For this project, I had to create a team profile generator that took in information from the user about thei team via the command line and outputted a HTML file that displayed the team information, each in their own card.

## Installation

To generate your own team profile, run 'npm install' to install the inquirer (listed as a Dependency in package.json) and jest (listed as a devDependecy in package.json) packages.

## Usage 

The user must run 'node app.js' in order to begin running the application. After the user has added all the team members they wish to add, "Wrote to new file!" will appear in the console and a new "team.html" file, with all their team members, will be present in the output folder.
